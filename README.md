# M3Z-part-library
A library of standardized 3D printable parts written in OpenSCAD

Quickstart:

The easiest and most direct way to make use of this part library is to:

1) Download this repo as a zip file or use git clone.
2) Find and use the ready-to-print STL files in the part library.
3) Print and build get building!

If you want or need to generate custom parts from our source code .scad files:

1) Download this repo as a zip file or use git clone.
2) Get OpenSCAD from http://openscad.org
3) Open the desired .scad file from the part library in OpenSCAD.
4) Edit parameters, hit render, and export an STL file.
5) Print and get building!

About M3Z:

The M3Z part system is similar to and was inspired by commercially available part systems such as Lego or Erector. It differs in that M3Z is an open and decentralized system both in terms of design and manufacturing of parts. Anyone can 3D print their own M3Z parts free of charge, and anyone can design and share their own M3Z parts without restriction.

M3Z parts can be roughly divided into two categories: structural parts and bridges. Structural parts are simple, strong, and easy to customize and print. They have 3mm holes laid out on a 10mm grid and can be joined together with standard metric M3 machine screws. These holes can also double as bushings for 3mm round steel rods which serve as axles for wheels and other rotating components. Bridges are parts that "bridge" between structural parts and a motor, sensor, or any other product or object. For example, a small servo motor attaches to a 3D printed M3Z servo bridge, which attaches to a chassis made of printed structural parts.
