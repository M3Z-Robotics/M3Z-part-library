# M3Z-part-library
A library of standardized 3D printable parts written in OpenSCAD

In brief:

The M3Z part system was conceived as a tool for makers, hobbyists, students, and educators. Anyone can download the source code for M3Z parts, edit them in OpenSCAD, render, and print them for use in a host of different applications. M3Z parts can be roughly divided into two categories: structural parts and bridges. Structural parts are simple, strong, and easy to customize and print. They have 3mm holes laid out on a 10mm grid and can be joined together with standard metric M3 machine screws. These holes also double as bushings for 3mm round steel rods which serve as axles for wheels and other rotating components. Bridges are parts that "bridge" between structural parts and a motor, sensor, or any other product or object. For example, a small servo motor attaches to a 3D printed M3Z servo bridge, which attaches to a chassis made of printed structural parts.

Why a standardized part system for 3D printing?

Standardization speeds up build workflows while lowering costs. Users can focus their efforts on designing and iterating any specialized components needed for their build, and simply use standard parts for the structure. Once a build is no longer being used, it can be disassembled and the parts re-used in a later build.

It also maximizes the utility of 3D printers and printed parts. Having a wide range of structural and connective parts available to print on-demand makes it so a 3D printer is all that is needed for many design applications. When a 3D printable part is designed to be M3Z-compatible, it instantly becomes much easier to work with and much more useful.

Finally, standardization fosters collaboration. Where there is a straightforward standard to follow, many different contributors from around the world can work together to create a cohesive extended system with minimal coordination.
